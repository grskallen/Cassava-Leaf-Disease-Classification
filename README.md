# Cassava Leaf Disease Classification  
This repository hosts the codebase for the "Cassava Leaf Disease Classification"  
challenge hosted on Kaggle.  

## Disclaimer  
Please note that this code is not an official  
release from Kaggle or any other authoritative entity.  
  
As the uploader is a novice, the code may contain imperfections  
or lack refinement.
